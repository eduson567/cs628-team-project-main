                 over 500 international students at our Seattle campus who come to CityU to complete their bachelors 
                 degree or earn a graduate degree. We continue our mission of offering access to a high quality, 
                 relevant U.S.-style degree to those in other countries. 
                 There are now partnerships with institutions in Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Mexico, Slovakia,
                  and Vietnam. No matter which program students choose, they gain global perspectives from their
                   peers while expanding their professional expertise.</p>
